# Honey-g Extension

This is an extension that will improve your productivity with the honey-g builds. There will be a few updates later to squeeze that extra productivity you will need on your daily basis.

## Install

Download the extension for your browser [here](http://github.open-war.com/honey-g-extension/).

Generate a new github token to be used by your new extension by accessing your [authorized applications](https://github.com/settings/applications).

![Install Step 1](http://github.open-war.com/honey-g-extension/assets/img/install-01.png)

With the new token generated, open the options page of your new extension by accessing the extensions url [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).

You should see your `Honey-g on Steroids` extension and a link to the `Options` page. Click it and paste the token on the 
`Github Access Token` password field. Click save and you can now access [http://honey-g/BranchBuilder/](http://honey-g/BranchBuilder/) to see the new PR information per build.

## TODO

- Add the ability to create build from a PR link.
